                    The value of investments may fluctuate and can result in loss of principal. Different types of investments 
                    involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will be 
                    profitable or suitable for a particular investor's financial situation or risk tolerance.

                    These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or related to these Terms, their subject matter, 
                    or their formation (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by 
                    and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Wyoming without giving effect to

                </p>

                <h2>14. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO 
                    FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You and the Company agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these 
                    Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or the use of the 
                    Website (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party 
                    retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction 
                    to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's 
                    copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>YOU AGREE THAT YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO

                </p>
                <p>
                    Unless you and the Company otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an 
                    individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, 
                    you and the Company each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the 
                    right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the 
                    actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, 
                    trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
                </p>

                    ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
                </p>

                <h2>16. Waiver and Severability</h2>
                <p>
                    No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or 
                    continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure 
                    of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such 
                    right or provision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be 
                    invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the 
                    minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.
                </p>
