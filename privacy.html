                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                <p>
                    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the 
                    security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure 
                    your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be 
                    guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other 
                    unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, 
                    or modify your information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information 
                    to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We implement the following security measures:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encryption of data in transit using SSL/TLS protocols</li>
                    <li>Regular security assessments and vulnerability testing</li>
                    <li>Access controls and authentication mechanisms</li>
                    <li>Regular backups and disaster recovery procedures</li>
                    <li>Employee training on data protection and security practices</li>
                    <li>Incident response procedures for data breaches</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we 
                    collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. 
                    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, 
                    and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure 
                    of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information, whether we can 
                    achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either 
                    delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal 
                    information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information 
                    and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
                <p>

                <h2>8. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting 
                    you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities 
                    monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing 
                    DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other 
                    mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
                </p>
